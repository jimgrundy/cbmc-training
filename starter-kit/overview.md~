# CBMC starter kit overview

The CBMC starter kit was written to make it easy to add CBMC verification
to a software repository.
This tutorial illustrates how to add the starter kit to the
FreeRTOS Kernel repository and how to start CBMC verification fo
a memory allocator in that repository.

## Clone the repository

The first step is to clone the FreeRTOS Kernel repository and
its submodules.

```
git clone https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel.git kernel
cd kernel; git submodule update --init --checkout --recursive
```

## Install the starter kit

The next step is to add the starter kit and the litani build system as
submodules.

```
mkdir -p kernel/test/cbmc
cd kernel/test/cbmc; git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aws-templates-for-cbmc-proofs.git starter-kit
cd kernel/test/cbmc; git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aws-build-accumulator.git litani
```
