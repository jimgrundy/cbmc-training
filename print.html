<p><a href="https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc">CBMC</a> is a model checker for
C. This means that CBMC will explore all possible paths through your code
on all possible inputs, and will check that all assertions in your code are
true.
CBMC is a bounded model checker, however, which means that using CBMC may
require restricting this set of all possible inputs to inputs of some
bounded size.
CBMC can also check for the possibility of
memory safety errors (like buffer overflow) and for instances of
undefined behavior (code whose behavior is left undefined by the C
specification).  CBMC has been used on
<a href="projects.html">over a dozen software projects</a> as part of software
development and continuous integration.</p>
<p>This book is a collection of tutorials and reference guides for using
CBMC in software verification.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cbmc-as-unit-testing"><a class="header" href="#cbmc-as-unit-testing">CBMC as unit testing</a></h1>
<p>Think of CBMC as a form of unit testing.  One of the things we can do
with unit testing is to run a function on a set of inputs, and to
compare the result  with the expected result.  Think of
CBMC as a unit tester that runs the function on all possible inputs.</p>
<p>Here is a
function <code>quartile</code> from <a href="cbmc/overview/quartile.c">quartile.c</a>
that returns the quartile of an integer between 0 and 99.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int quartile(int x) {
  int y;

  if (x &lt; 0 || x &gt; 99) return 0;

  if (x &lt; 50)
    if (x &lt; 25)
      y = 1;
    else
      y = 2;
  else
    if (x &lt; 75)
      y = 3;
    else
      y = 4;

  return y;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here a unit test from <a href="cbmc/overview/unit-test.c">unit-test.c</a> that tests
<code>quartile</code> using a number in the first quartile.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
int quartile(int x);

int main() {
  int x = 1;
  int result = quartile(x);
  assert(result == 1);
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can build the unit test with <code>gcc</code> and run it.
When we do, the unit test runs successfully,
and the assertion does not fail:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">gcc quartile.c unit-test.c -o unit-test
./unit-test
</code></pre>
<p>But we can also build the unit test with <code>goto-cc</code>, which is a drop-in
replacement for <code>gcc</code> that comes with CBMC.  Now we can use CBMC to
run the unit test, and again the assertion does not fail:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">goto-cc quartile.c unit-test.c -o unit-test
cbmc ./unit-test
</code></pre>
<pre><code>** Results:
unit-test.c function main
[main.assertion.1] line 8 assertion result == 1: SUCCESS

** 0 of 1 failed (1 iterations)
VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL
</code></pre>
<p>But now we can do something interesting with CBMC.
The unit test currently initializes the
variable <code>x</code> to 1, and CBMC considers the value of <code>x</code> to be 1.  If
we remove the initializer, CBMC considers the value of <code>x</code> to be any
possible value of type <code>int</code>. We say that CBMC treats uninitialized
variables as having unconstrained values.</p>
<p>If we rewrite the unit test</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
int quartile(int x);

int main() {
  int x; // The value of x is now any value of type int
  int result = quartile(x);
  assert(result == 1);
}
</code></pre>
<p>and rerun CBMC</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">goto-cc quartile.c unit-test.c -o unit-test
cbmc ./unit-test
</code></pre>
<pre><code>** Results:
unit-test.c function main
[main.assertion.1] line 8 assertion result == 1: FAILURE

** 1 of 1 failed (2 iterations)
VERIFICATION FAILED
</code></pre>
<p>we can see that the assertion has failed.  We can ask CBMC to produce
an error trace that demonstrates one way in which the assertion can fail</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cbmc ./unit-test --trace
</code></pre>
<pre><code>** Results:
unit-test.c function main
[main.assertion.1] line 8 assertion result == 1: FAILURE

</code></pre>
<p>and we see that in the first step of this error trace the variable <code>x</code>
is initialized to the integer value <code>x=-2147483547</code>.</p>
<p>Well, that's not quite what we intended.  We don't expect <code>quartile</code>
to return 1 on every integer, just on integers in the first quartile.
We can constrain <code>x</code> to be an integer in the first quartile by adding
an assumption to the unit test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
int quartile(int x);

int main() {
  int x;
  __CPROVER_assume(0 &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt; 25);    // this is a precondition
  int result = quartile(x);
  assert(result == 1);                   // this is a postcondition
}
</code></pre>
<p>Rerunning CBMC, we see that the assertion is always true:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">goto-cc quartile.c unit-test.c -o unit-test
cbmc unit-test
</code></pre>
<pre><code>** Results:
unit-test.c function main
[main.assertion.1] line 9 assertion result == 1: SUCCESS

** 0 of 1 failed (1 iterations)
VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL
</code></pre>
<p>Let's pause for a moment to notice that we have already done something
interesting.
We have proved that the function <code>quartile</code> returns 1 when it is called
on any integer in the first quartile.
We have partially specified the behavior of the function using
a precondition (the assumption that <code>x</code> is in the first quartile)
and a postcondition (the assertion that the return value is <code>1</code>).
If the function is called with an input that satisifes the precondition,
then the function returns with a value that satisfies the postcondition.
Of course, we have only partially specified the behavior of the function.
What happens when it is called with an integer in the second
quartile?  The specification doesn't say.  But we have taken
the first step toward specificiation and verification of our function.</p>
<p>Finally, to make the connection between unit testing and model
checking,
we have replaced <code>gcc</code> with <code>goto-cc</code> and run the result with <code>cbmc</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">goto-cc quartile.c unit-test.c -o unit-test
cbmc unit-test
</code></pre>
<p>For programs this simple, however, we can skip explicit compilation
and invoke <code>cbmc</code> directly:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cbmc quartile.c unit-test.c
</code></pre>

<p>CBMC considers uninitialized variables to have unconstrained values.
When CBMC examines this program, it finds an uninitialized variable <code>x</code>
of type <code>int</code>.  The type <code>int</code> describes a set of integer values that
a variable of type <code>int</code> can assume.  CBMC considers all executions
of the program in which <code>x</code> assumes all values of type <code>int</code>.  At least
one of those values is not 0, and in that execution of the program,
the assertion fails.</p>
<p>We can see what value CBMC discovered for <code>x</code>
by asking CBMC to produce an error trace whenever it finds
an assertion failure.  We do this by running CBMC with
the flag <code>--trace</code>. The trace describes one step-by-step
path through the code that leads to the assertion failure.  For
example, the output of the command</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cbmc --trace int1.c
</code></pre>
<p>consists of a single step</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">State 24 file int1.c function main line 4 thread 0

<pre><code class="language-bash">cbmc int2.c

<p>then CBMC reports that the verification is successful.</p>
<p>NOTE: The first state in the trace printed above
is numbered 24 because CBMC runs through
a number of its own internal steps before getting to the

own internal steps, only states corresponding to variable
assignments in our own code.</p>
<h2 id="unrolling-loops"><a class="header" href="#unrolling-loops">Unrolling loops</a></h2>
<p>CBMC is a <em>bounded</em> model checker for C.  CBMC works
by unwinding the loops in our code (ie by unrolling/inlining a finite number of iterations of the loop). CBMC needs to know a bound on the number of times it is expected to unwind any particular
loop in our code.</p>
<p>Sometimes CBMC can figure this out on its own.
Consider the program <a href="cbmc/overview/examples/assertions/loop1.c">loop1.c</a></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include&lt;assert.h&gt;

int main() {
  unsigned array[10];

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    array[i] = 0;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    assert(array[i] == 0);
  }
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>and run CBMC with</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cbmc loop1.c
</code></pre>
<p>and CBMC will print</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">[main.assertion.1] line 11 assertion array[i] == 0: SUCCESS

<p>Sometimes CBMC needs help.  Consider the program <a href="cbmc/overview/examples/assertions/loop2.c">loop2.c</a></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include&lt;assert.h&gt;

int main() {
  unsigned bound;
  unsigned array[bound];

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; bound; i++) {
    array[i] = 0;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; bound; i++) {
    assert(array[i] == 0);

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>and run CBMC with</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cbmc loop2.c
</code></pre>
<p>and CBMC will unwind the first loop forever.  We need to tell CBMC how
many times to unwind the loops in the program.
Run CBMC with</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cbmc --unwind 11 loop2.c
</code></pre>
<p>and CBMC will unwind every loop in the program 10 times (not 11 times!) and
print</p>

</code></pre>
<h2 id="unrolling-loops-soundly"><a class="header" href="#unrolling-loops-soundly">Unrolling loops soundly</a></h2>
<p>Now, however, we have a problem.  CBMC has proved that there is no assertion
failure in the program as long as we limit loops to 10 iterations.  But
how do we know that 10 iterations is enough?  What if it is possible for a
loop to iterate 11 times, and the error we are looking for occurs on the
11th iteration?</p>
<p>We can ask CBMC to prove that we have unwounded loops enough times: We
can ask CBMC to prove that the loop termination condition is guaranteed
to be true after the specified number of unwindings.  We do this by
running CBMC with the flag <code>--unwinding-assertions</code>.  For example, running
CBMC on the first program <a href="cbmc/overview/examples/assertions/loop1.c">loop1.c</a> with</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cbmc --unwind 11 --unwinding-assertions loop1.c
</code></pre>
<p>succeeds with</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL

<p>but running CBMC on the second program <a href="cbmc/overview/examples/assertions/loop2.c">loop2.c</a> with</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cbmc --unwind 11 --unwinding-assertions loop2.c
</code></pre>
<p>fails with output that includes</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">[main.unwind.0] line 7 unwinding assertion loop 0: FAILURE
VERIFICATION FAILED
</code></pre>
<h2 id="proof-assumptions"><a class="header" href="#proof-assumptions">Proof assumptions</a></h2>
<p>In hindsight, the problem is obvious: If the initialized variable <code>bound</code>
happens to begin with the value <code>11</code>, then unwinding loops only 10 times will
not be enough.
If we are only going to unwind loops 10 times, then we have to restrict
ourselves to arrays of at most 10 elements.
We need to tell CBMC to assume that <code>bound</code> is at most 10.
We make this assumption with the instrinsic function <code>__CPROVER_assume</code>.
Consider the program <a href="cbmc/overview/examples/assertions/loop2a.c">loop2a.c</a></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include&lt;assert.h&gt;

int main() {
  unsigned bound;
  unsigned array[bound];

  __CPROVER_assume(bound &lt; 11);

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; bound; i++) {
    array[i] = 0;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; bound; i++) {
    assert(array[i] == 0);
  }
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>and run CBMC with the command</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cbmc --unwind 11 --unwinding-assertions loop2a.c
</code></pre>
<p>and CBMC reports success.</p>
<p>We now come, however, to the harsh reality of mathematical proof:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every proof makes assumptions, and the quality of the proof depends on the quality of the assumptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the proof assumptions are true in practice,
then the proof is valid in practice.
If the assumptions are only sometimes true, however,
then the proof is valid only in those cases.</p>
<p>When we write a proof for a function, we generally make three classes of
assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>we may bound the size of input to the function with explicit assumptions
like <code>bound &lt; 11</code>,</li>
<li>we may model the environment of the function with a proof harness that
we will describe in the next section, and</li>
<li>we may stub out some of the functions invoked by the function under test.</li>
</ul>
<p>When reading or writing a proof, it is essential to pay attention to
the assumptions being made, and to make these assumptions as explicit
and easy-to-find as possible.</p>

<p>and we want to test function <code>beta2</code>.  This time the function <code>beta2</code>
depends on its input <code>b</code>, but it also depends on a global variable
<code>counter</code> that is initialized to <code>0</code> but is changed with each invocation
of <code>beta2</code>.  We want to know that <code>beta2</code> always works, no matter how
many times <code>beta2</code> has been invoked in the past.</p>
<p>We do this by writing a proof harness that choses an unconstrained value
for both the function input <code>b</code> and the global variable <code>counter</code>.
We write a proof harness <a href="cbmc/overview/examples/harness/harness2.c">harness2.c</a></p>

<h2 id="modeling-interfaces"><a class="header" href="#modeling-interfaces">Modeling interfaces</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes a function depends on an implementation of an interface that
we don't care to test.  A common example is a function the depends on
a network communication protocol like HTTP with <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code>
methods.  We want our code to work independent of the protocol implementation,
so we replace the implementations of the functions in the protocol interface
with stubs that over-approximate the behaviors of the implementations.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a library <a href="cbmc/overview/examples/harness/library3.c">library3.c</a></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;assert.h&gt;

void send(int msg);
int receive();

int alpha(int x) {
    int y = receive();
    assert(y &gt; 0);
    return y+1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>that depends on <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code> methods from a network interface.
We stub out the network interface with <a href="cbmc/overview/examples/harness/network3.c">network3.c</a></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int receive() {
    // model receiving an unconstrained integer value from the network

    // model sending an integer over the network (nothing to do)
    return;

<p>We write the proof harness <a href="cbmc/overview/examples/harness/harness3.c">harness3.c</a></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int alpha(int x);

main() {
    int x;
    alpha(x);

</code></pre>
<p>and we get a failure of the assertion <code>y &gt; 0</code>.</p>
<p>Suppose the mistake is in our model of the network.  Suppose our
network only transmits positive integers.  Then we can fix our stub of
the <code>receive</code> method to return not an unconstrained integer but an
unconstrained positive integer.
We change our stubs for the network to <a href="cbmc/overview/examples/harness/network3a.c">network3a.c</a></p>

<p>and declare victory at the successful verification.</p>
<h2 id="allocating-data"><a class="header" href="#allocating-data">Allocating data</a></h2>
<p>For projects where functions take pointers to data on the heap, we
recommend writing functions to allocate unconstrained values on the
heap of the appropriate types for use in proof harnesses.</p>
<p>Consider a string buffer defined by</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">typedef struct { size_t length; char* buffer; } strbuf;
</code></pre>
<p>and consider a function that takes a pointer to a string buffer and
caches the fifth character in the buffer into a global variable</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char cache;
void cache_fifth_char(strbuf* str) { cache = str-&gt;buffer[4]; }
</code></pre>
<p>Let's try to prove that this function is memory safe (although,
obviously, it is not).  Memory safety means that we never dereference
an invalid pointer and we never try to access data outside the bounds
of a valid object.  We can do this by calling CBMC with the flags
<code>--pointer-check</code> and <code>--bounds-check</code>.  Let's prove this even in the
case where malloc can fail and return NULL instead of a pointer.  The
default model of malloc in CBMC never fails, but we can change to a
model of mailloc that can fail and return NULL by calling CBMC with
the flags <code>--malloc-may-fail</code> and <code>--malloc-fail-null</code>.</p>
<p>The function <code>cache_fifth_char</code> takes a pointer to a string buffer on
the heap, so let write a function that allocates a string buffer.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">strbuf* strbuf_allocate(size_t length) {
  strbuf* str = malloc(sizeof(strbuf));
  if (str == NULL) return NULL;
  str-&gt;length = length;
  str-&gt;buffer = malloc(length);
  return str;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can write a proof harness for the function</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">main() {
  size_t len;
  strbuf* str = strbuf_allocate(len);

  cache_fifth_char(str);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Pulling all of this together into a single file
<a href="cbmc/overview/examples/harness/strbuf1.c">strbuf1.c</a>, we can run cbmc on this file
with</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cbmc --pointer-check --bounds-check --malloc-may-fail --malloc-fail-null strbuf1.c
</code></pre>
<p>and the result is a slew of verification failures including</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">[cache_fifth_char.pointer_dereference.1] line 7 dereference failure: pointer NULL in str-&gt;buffer: FAILURE
[cache_fifth_char.pointer_dereference.7] line 7 dereference failure: pointer NULL in str-&gt;buffer[(signed long int)4]: FAILURE
[cache_fifth_char.pointer_dereference.11] line 7 dereference failure: pointer outside object bounds in str-&gt;buffer[(signed long int)4]: FAILURE
</code></pre>
<p>The first is saying that <code>str</code> may be NULL, the second is saying that
<code>str-&gt;buffer</code> may be NULL, and the third is saying that <code>str-&gt;buffer</code>
may not have 5 character in it.</p>
<p>We are obviously going to have to make some assumptions about the
string buffer before we can prove that the function is memory safe.</p>
<h2 id="validating-data"><a class="header" href="#validating-data">Validating data</a></h2>
<p>For projects that require allocating objects of various types on the heap, we
recommend writing predicates that say what well-formed objects of these
types look like.</p>
<p>In the case of our example, a valid pointer to a string buffer must be
nonnull, and a valid string buffer must have a buffer that is non-null.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">bool strbuf_is_valid(strbuf* str) {
  if (str == NULL) return false;
  if (str-&gt;buffer == NULL) return false;
  return true;
}
</code></pre>
<p>With this predicate, we can write a proof harness that assumes the string
buffer allocated on the heap is valid before calling the function.  We can
also assert that the string buffer remains valid after calling the function.
And we can assume that the buffer has at least 5 characters in it.
In fact, we can prove the this remains true after the function invocation,
meaning that the function preserves the validity of its input.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">main() {
  size_t len;
  strbuf* str = strbuf_allocate(len);

  __CPROVER_assume(strbuf_is_valid(str));
  __CPROVER_assume(str-&gt;length &gt; 4);

  cache_fifth_char(str);

  __CPROVER_assert(strbuf_is_valid(str), &quot;String buffer remains valid&quot;);
  __CPROVER_assert(str-&gt;length &gt; 4, &quot;String buffer remains length &gt;4&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Pulling all of this together into <a href="cbmc/overview/examples/harness/strbuf2.c">strbuf2.c</a>,
we can run CBMC</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cbmc --pointer-check --bounds-check --malloc-may-fail --malloc-fail-null strbuf2.c
</code></pre>
<p>and rejoice in the successful validation.</p>
<h2 id="proof-assumptions-1"><a class="header" href="#proof-assumptions-1">Proof assumptions</a></h2>
<p>Notice that in our last proof harness, we worked hard to make as
explicit as possible all of the assumptions required for memory safety
to hold: The pointer must be a valid pointer to a valid string buffer
with at least five characters in it. It is the responsibility of the
programmer to make certain that these assumptions are true when the
function is called.
All bets are off when the function is called in a weaker context where some of these assumptions are false. The memory safety proof of the function does not hold in that context since the assumptions it is based on do not hold.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cbmc-starter-kit-overview"><a class="header" href="#cbmc-starter-kit-overview">CBMC starter kit overview</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-templates-for-cbmc-proofs">CBMC starter kit</a>
makes it easy to add CBMC verification to a software project.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we want to verify the memory safety of a memory allocator that
comes with the <a href="https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel">FreeRTOS Kernel</a>.
The kernel comes with five allocators, and we look at the simplest one.
It allocates blocks from a region of memory set aside for the heap.
It maintains a linked list of free blocks and allocates a block from
the first block in the free list that is big enough to satisfy the request.
When the block is freed, it is added back to the free list and merged with
adjacent free blocks already in the free list.
The function we want to prove memory safe is the allocator
<a href="https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/blob/main/portable/MemMang/heap_5.c#L155"><code>pvPortMalloc</code></a>
in the source file
<a href="https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/blob/main/portable/MemMang/heap_5.c">portable/MemMang/heap_5.c</a>.</p>
<p>Using the starter kit consists of five steps</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="starter-kit/overview/index.html#clone-the-source-repository">Clone the source repository</a></li>
<li><a href="starter-kit/overview/index.html#add-the-starter-kit">Add the starter kit</a></li>

<li><a href="starter-kit/overview/index.html#run-cbmc">Run CBMC</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For each step, we give the shell commands required to implement
the step, and we examine what changes the commands have made to the repository.
A reader wanting
to push as rapidly as possible to the verification can simply cut-and-paste
the commands into a shell and begin the verification.  A reader wanting to
understand how the starter kit works can pause to read the explanations.</p>
<h2 id="clone-the-source-repository"><a class="header" href="#clone-the-source-repository">Clone the source repository</a></h2>
<h3 id="commands"><a class="header" href="#commands">Commands</a></h3>
<p>The first step is to clone the FreeRTOS Kernel repository and
its submodules, and to create a <code>cbmc</code> subdirectory to hold
everything related to CBMC verification:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel.git kernel
cd kernel
git submodule update --init --checkout --recursive
mkdir cbmc
cd cbmc
</code></pre>
<h3 id="explanation"><a class="header" href="#explanation">Explanation</a></h3>
<p>The name of the directory <code>cbmc</code> and its location within the
repository is unimportant.  Just choose a reasonable place
within the repository.  For example, you could put <code>cbmc</code>
under a <code>test</code> or <code>verification</code> directory that contains your unit
tests and other verification work.</p>
<h2 id="add-the-starter-kit"><a class="header" href="#add-the-starter-kit">Add the starter kit</a></h2>
<h3 id="commands-1"><a class="header" href="#commands-1">Commands</a></h3>
<p>The next step is to add the starter kit and the litani build system as
submodules.</p>
<pre><code>git submodule add https://github.com/awslabs/aws-templates-for-cbmc-proofs.git starter-kit
git submodule add https://github.com/awslabs/aws-build-accumulator.git litani
</code></pre>
<h3 id="explanation-1"><a class="header" href="#explanation-1">Explanation</a></h3>
<p>The first command adds the starter kit as a submodule.</p>
<p>The second command adds the litani build system as a submodule.
Litani is the build system used by the starter kit.  For the purpose of
this tutorial, what makes litani interesting is that the starter kit
uses litani to do CBMC verification as concurrently as possible, and
to build a dashboard of the results.</p>
<h2 id="configure-the-starter-kit"><a class="header" href="#configure-the-starter-kit">Configure the starter kit</a></h2>
<h3 id="commands-2"><a class="header" href="#commands-2">Commands</a></h3>
<p>The next step is to configure CBMC verification for this project and
copy the contents of the starter kit into place.
We need to know the answers to three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the root of the repository?
<ul>
<li>Since <code>kernel/cbmc</code> is the current directory and <code>kernel</code> is the root
of the repository, we will use the relative path <code>..</code> to the root.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the path to the litani build tool?
<ul>
<li>Since litani is located in
the root of the litani submodule, we will use the relative path <code>litani/litani</code>
to the tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the name of the project?
<ul>
<li>We will use the name <code>Kernel</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's run the setup script:</p>
<pre><code>./starter-kit/scripts/setup.py
What is the path to the source root? ..
What is the path to the litani script? ./litani/litani
What is the project name? Kernel
</code></pre>
<h3 id="explanation-2"><a class="header" href="#explanation-2">Explanation</a></h3>
<p>Looking at the <code>cbmc</code> directory, we see that a few subdirectories have
been added to <code>cbmc</code>.</p>
<pre><code>ls
</code></pre>
<pre><code>include         negative_tests  sources         stubs
litani          proofs          starter-kit
</code></pre>
<p>In addition to litani and the starter-kit submodules, we see</p>
<ul>
<li><code>include</code> for header files written for verification.</li>
<li><code>sources</code> for common source files written for verification.</li>
<li><code>stubs</code> for any stubs of project code written for verification.
Examples of useful stubs for a communication protocol might be models of
the <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code> methods that interact with the physical network.</li>
<li><code>proofs</code> for the verification itself.  In the end, this directory will
contain one subdirectory for every function or entry point we want to verify.
This <code>proofs</code> directory is usually just a flat collection of subdirectories,
but these subdirectories can be nested if it makes sense to group
together the verification of similar functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>proofs</code> directory itself is worth further examination.</p>
<pre><code>ls proofs
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Makefile-project-defines        Makefile.common
Makefile-project-targets        README.md
Makefile-project-testing        run-cbmc-proofs.py
Makefile-template-defines
</code></pre>
<p>The important files are</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Makefile.common</code> implements best practices for verification using CBMC.
It describes a method of building the goto binary for
CBMC that is likely to yield good CBMC performance, and it describes
a set of checks we recommend performing with CBMC.  It invokes CBMC
several times to do property checking and coverage checking (currently
just line coverage and not branch coverage), and it
invokes a tool that builds a dashboard of the results in a form
that is easy to debug.  It works by calling
<code>litani</code> to perform all of these build and verification steps with
maximal concurrency.</li>
<li><code>run-cbmc-proofs.py</code> is a script that runs with maximal concurrency
all of the CBMC verification under the <code>proofs</code> directory, and builds
a dashboard of the results.
In another tutorial, we will introduce our
implementation of continuous integration that runs all of the CBMC verification
against each pull request to check that proposed code changes
preserve the CBMC results.  This is the script invoked by continuous integration
to run the verification.</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining Makefiles are just hooks for describing project-specific
modifications or definitions.  For example, within <code>Makefile-project-defines</code>
you can define the <code>INCLUDES</code> variable to set the search path for the header
files needed to build the project functions being verified.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/blob/main/portable/MemMang/heap_5.c#L155"><code>pvPortMalloc</code></a>
in the source file
<a href="https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/blob/main/portable/MemMang/heap_5.c">portable/MemMang/heap_5.c</a>.  We need to know the answers to four questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the function name?
<ul>
<li>We will use <code>pvPortMalloc</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the path to the source file defining the function?
<ul>
<li>Since <code>kernel/cbmc/proofs</code> is the current directory and
<code>kernel/portable/MemMang/heap_5.c</code> is the source file, we will use the
relative path <code>../../portable/MemMang/heap_5.c</code> to the file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the path to the source root?
<ul>
<li>Since <code>kernel/cbmc/proofs</code> is the current directory and
<code>kernel</code> is the source file, we will use the relative path <code>../..</code>
to the source root.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the path to the 'proofs' directory (usually '.')?
<ul>
<li>Since <code>kernel/test/cbmc/proofs</code> is the current directory,
we will just use <code>.</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's run the setup script:</p>
<pre><code>../starter-kit/scripts/setup-proof.py
What is the function name? pvPortMalloc
What is the path to the source file defining the function? ../../portable/MemMang/heap_5.c
What is the path to the source root? ../..
What is the path to the 'proofs' directory (usually '.')? .
</code></pre>
<h3 id="explanation-3"><a class="header" href="#explanation-3">Explanation</a></h3>
<p>The <code>proofs</code> directory now contains a subdirectory <code>pvPortMalloc</code>
for verification of the memory allocator <code>pvPortMalloc</code>.</p>
<pre><code>ls pvPortMalloc

<pre><code>Makefile                cbmc-proof.txt

<h2 id="write-the-proof"><a class="header" href="#write-the-proof">Write the proof</a></h2>
<p>Let's change to the <code>pvPortMalloc</code> subdirectory:</p>
<pre><code>cd pvPortMalloc
</code></pre>
<h3 id="building-source-code"><a class="header" href="#building-source-code">Building source code</a></h3>
<p>Every software project has its own build procedure.  It is quite likely
that if you can build the project for execution with <code>make CC=gcc</code> then
you can build the project for model checking by CBMC with <code>make CC=goto-cc</code>.
The compiler
<code>goto-cc</code> is a drop-in replacement for <code>gcc</code> that compiles
source code into a <em>goto program</em> used by CBMC.  In theory, you can link
your proof harness against this goto program and run CBMC on the result.
In practice,
the result is huge and the performance of CBMC is disappointing.
Our approach is to build only the source code that is required to run
the function under test.</p>
<p>In our case, all we need is the single file
<a href="https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/blob/main/portable/MemMang/heap_5.c">kernel/portable/MemMang/heap_5.c</a>.</p>
<p>Building FreeRTOS requires a configuration file, so let's add to the current
directory a slightly simplified <a href="starter-kit/overview/FreeRTOSconfig.h">FreeRTOSconfig.h</a> that we have
taken from another repository that demonstrates FreeRTOS.
Building FreeRTOS also requires an implementation of a portable interface, so
let's use an implementation in <code>kernel/portable/ThirdParty/GCC/Posix</code> that comes
with the kernel repository.</p>
<p>Now we can build heap_5.c with</p>
<pre><code>gcc -I. -I../../include -I../../portable/ThirdParty/GCC/Posix \
  ../../portable/MemMang/heap_5.c
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-proof-harness"><a class="header" href="#the-proof-harness">The proof harness</a></h3>
<p>Let's look at the initial outline of the proof harness <code>pvPortMalloc_harness.c</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/**
 * @file pvPortMalloc_harness.c
 * @brief Implements the proof harness for pvPortMalloc function.
 */

/*
 * Insert project header files that
 *   - include the declaration of the function
 *   - include the types needed to declare function arguments
 */

void harness()
{

  /* Insert argument declarations */

  pvPortMalloc( /* Insert arguments */ );
}
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing we need to do is add the prototype for <code>pvPortMalloc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>void * pvPortMalloc( size_t xWantedSize );
</code></pre>
<p>This prototype refers to the type <code>size_t</code>, so we need to add the header file
defining this type</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we need to allocate an unconstrained value for <code>xWantedSize</code>
and add <code>xWantedSize</code> to the invocation of <code>pvPortMalloc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  size_t xWantedSize;
  pvPortMalloc( xWantedSize );
</code></pre>
<p>The final proof harness <code>pvPortMalloc_harness.c</code> is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/**
 * @file pvPortMalloc_harness.c
 * @brief Implements the proof harness for pvPortMalloc function.
 */

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
void * pvPortMalloc( size_t xWantedSize );

void harness()
{
  size_t xWantedSize;
  pvPortMalloc( xWantedSize );
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-makefile"><a class="header" href="#the-makefile">The makefile</a></h3>
<p>Let's look at the initial outline of <code>Makefile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>HARNESS_ENTRY = harness
HARNESS_FILE = pvPortMalloc_harness

# This should be a unique identifier for this proof, and will appear on the
# Litani dashboard. It can be human-readable and contain spaces if you wish.

# restrict the number of EXPENSIVE CBMC jobs running at once. See the
# documentation in Makefile.common under the &quot;Job Pools&quot; heading for details.
# EXPENSIVE = true

include ../Makefile.common
</code></pre>
<p>All we need to do here is to define the search path for the needed header
files.  Since the variable <code>$(SRCDIR)</code> points to the root of the repository
(the source root), and the variabld <code>$(PROOFDIR)</code> points to the current
proof directory, all we need to do is add the lines</p>
<pre><code>INCLUDES += -I$(PROOFDIR)

</code></pre>
<h2 id="run-cbmc"><a class="header" href="#run-cbmc">Run CBMC</a></h2>
<p>Now we can run CBMC on <code>pvPortMalloc</code> with</p>
<pre><code>make
</code></pre>
<p>This takes about 30 seconds on MacOS.
It builds the proof harness, builds the relevant source code, links them
together, runs CBMC several times to do property checking and coverage checking,
and runs another tool to build a summary of the results that can be opened
in a web browser.  On MacOS, open the report with</p>
<pre><code>open report/html/index.html
</code></pre>
<p>and study the results.</p>
<p>With this, in just minutes, you have used the starter kit to get started
writing CBMC proofs for the FreeRTOS kernel.  The proof is not done.  If you
look at the report you have opened in your web browser, you can see that
the current proof harness fails to exercise a large fraction of the function
<code>pvPortMalloc</code>.  For example, the proof harness currently fails to allocate

<ol>
<li>Make a dependency graph of the modules in your program.
There are a number of tools that can help with this, including <a href="https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/">doxygen</a>.
In addition, you can manually determine a good approximation to the dependency graph using the <code>.h</code> files.
If a module includes the <code>.h</code> file of another module, it likely depends on it.</li>
<li>Select the leaves of the graph - those modules which other modules depend upon, but which do not depend on other modules themselves.
Typically, these include the basic data-structures and algorithms used by the rest of the codebase.
Which one of these you choose is a matter of style: you can use the  <a href="management/Code-for-verification.html">guidelines for coding for verification</a> to help select modules which are likely to be good verification targets.</li>
<li>Inside a given module, select the best initial verification target.
This is often, but not always, one of the simpler functions.
In particular, you are looking for a function which is both easy to verify, and will give good insight into the data-structure invariants of the data-structures used in the given module.
The more a function conforms to our <a href="management/Code-for-verification.html">guidelines for coding for verification</a>, the easiest it will be to verify.
In our experience, it often makes sense to start with allocation or initialization functions (which often have named that end in <code>_alloc()</code> or <code>_init()</code>.</li>
<li>The first proof for a given module is typically the hardest.
It typically requires the creation of an <code>_is_valid()</code> function and an <code>_ensure_is_allocated()</code> function.
However, once these have been written once, the remainder of the module becomes much easier.
The amount of time needed to complete a proof can vary significantly, from hours for a simple proof to days for a complex one.
If the function has few dependencies, and conforms to the guidelines for coding for verification, we would expect an initial proof to take perhaps a day's work.[TODO I made up this number.  We need data]
If it is taking longer than this, try a different entry-point.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-get-a-sense-of-the-work-cbmc-will-involve"><a class="header" href="#how-to-get-a-sense-of-the-work-cbmc-will-involve">How to get a sense of the work CBMC will involve</a></h2>
<p>We recommend selecting a few (2-3) modules from the leaves of the dependency graph, and then doing 2-3 proofs from each module.
This will give you a sense of</p>
<ol>
<li>How much work the first proof in a new module is</li>
<li>How much work subsequent proofs in that module is, once the <code>_is_valid()</code> and <code>_ensure_is_allocated()</code> functions are written.</li>
</ol>
<p>Predicting precisely how hard a piece of code will be to verify can be difficult.
In general, however, the more code conforms to our <a href="management/Code-for-verification.html">guidelines for coding for verification</a>, the easier it will be to verify.
We recommend trying  modules of different verification complexity to get a sense of overall expected effort.</p>
<p>Particular features to look for are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the code have loops?
<ol>
<li>If so, are those loops nested?
Since CBMC unrolls loops before verifying them, nested loops can lead to a quadratic (or worse) increase in the amount of work CBMC will need to perform.</li>
<li>Are they over fixed sizes, or do they vary with the size of inputs?
If loops are of fixed size, it may be hard to simplify the problem if CBMC is having performance issues as the proof is being developed.
On the other hand, once the proof is complete, functions with fixed-sized loops may have higher assurance proofs, since data-structures do not need to be bounded for performance reasons.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Does the code use inductive data-structures (e.g. linked lists, trees)?
Inductive data-structures are much harder to model and verify than linear structures such as arrays.</li>
<li>Does the code have function pointers?
Function pointers are hard to model.
They can also cause performance problems for CBMC.</li>
<li>Does the code have an simple and obvious specification?
One of the main challenges in verification is writing the specification.
The simpler the specification of the code being verified, the easier it is to verify.
Similarly, the better the documentation, the easier it is.</li>

<h2 id="the-components-of-a-cbmc-proof"><a class="header" href="#the-components-of-a-cbmc-proof">The components of a CBMC proof</a></h2>
<p>A CBMC proof normally consists of several components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A <strong>proof harness</strong> which:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sets up required data-structures</li>
<li>Calls the function being verified</li>
<li>Checks any function post-conditions</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>proof makefile</strong> which:</p>
<ol>
<li>Defines any necessary preprocessor defines
e.g. <code>-DMAX_BUFFER_SIZE=10</code></li>
<li>Specifies the dependencies of the code under test</li>
<li>Specifies any abstractions or models used by proof</li>
</ol>
<p>Much of the work done by these Makefiles is common among proofs.
We provide a <code>Makefile.common</code>, which provides useful makefile rules shared by all proofs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A set of <strong><code>_is_valid()</code> functions</strong>, one for each <strong>datatype</strong> used in the proof</p>
<ol>
<li>Typically go in the code-base itself</li>
<li>Can be used in the codebase as assertions to improve runtime checking.</li>
<li>Can be reused by multiple proofs</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A set of <strong><code>_allocate()</code> and <code>ensure()</code> functions</strong>,  one for each <strong>datatype</strong> used in the proof</p>
<ol>
<li>Due to limitations of the CBMC tools, not all properties about a datatype can be declared declaratively.
In particular, allocation of memory must be done impartively.
These functions handle allocation of the data-structure, and any recursive substructures.</li>
<li>Can be put in a library and reused by multiple proofs.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>library of helper functions</strong> which:</p>
<ol>
<li>Models any external libraries (e.g. libCrypto)</li>
<li>Provides implementations for abstracted functions</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The remainder of this document describes how build each one of these components.</p>
<h2 id="running-example"><a class="header" href="#running-example">Running example.</a></h2>
<p>We will use the <code>aws_array_list</code> module from <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-common">AWS C Common</a> open-source project as our running example.
This module provides a polymorphic array defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct aws_array_list {
    struct aws_allocator *alloc;
    size_t current_size;
    size_t length;
    size_t item_size;
    void *data;
};
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>alloc</code> represents the allocator used by the list (to allow consumers of the list to override <code>malloc</code> if desired)</li>
<li><code>current_size</code> represents the bytes of memory that the array has allocated</li>
<li><code>length</code> is the number of items that it contains</li>
<li><code>data_size</code> represents the size of the objects stored in the list (in bytes)</li>
<li><code>data</code> points to a byte array in memory that contains the data of the array list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users of this data structure are expected to access its fields using getter and setter methods, although C does not offer language support to ensure that they do so.
Similarly, since the C type system does not have support for polymorphism, authors of the getters and setters are responsible for ensuring that the list is accessed safely.
The getter itself is defined as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int aws_array_list_get_at_ptr(const struct aws_array_list *AWS_RESTRICT list, void **val, size_t index) {
    if (aws_array_list_length(list) &gt; index) {
        *val = (void *)((uint8_t *)list-&gt;data + (list-&gt;item_size * index));
        return AWS_OP_SUCCESS;
    }
    return aws_raise_error(AWS_ERROR_INVALID_INDEX);
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-proof-harness-1"><a class="header" href="#the-proof-harness-1">The Proof harness</a></h2>
<h3 id="what-does-a-good-proof-harness-look-like"><a class="header" href="#what-does-a-good-proof-harness-look-like">What does a good proof harness look like?</a></h3>
<p>Syntactically, a proof harness looks quite similar to a unit test.
The main difference is that a proof harness calls the target function with a partially-constrained input rather than a concrete value; when symbolically executed by CBMC, this has the effect of exploring the function under <em>all</em> possible inputs that satisfy the constraints.</p>
<p>We have developed a style of writing proofs that we believe is readable, maintainable, and modular.
This style was driven by feedback from developers, and addresses the need to communicate <em>exactly what we are proving</em> to developers and users.</p>
<p>Our proofs have the following features:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are structured as <em>harnesses</em> that call into the function being verified, similar to unit tests.
This makes them easier to write, because they follow a pattern most developers are familiar with.
This style also yields more useful error traces.
Most importantly, it makes proofs easier to understand and maintain, since a developer reviewing a proof has an &quot;executable&quot; which they can understand using their existing knowledge and intuition about C code.</li>
<li>They state their assumptions declaratively.
Rather than creating a fully-initialized data structure in imperative style, we create unconstrained data structures and then constrain them just enough to prove the property of interest.
This means the only assumptions on the data structure's values are the ones we state in the harness.</li>
<li>They follow a predictable pattern: setting up data structures, assuming preconditions on them, calling into the code being verified, and asserting postconditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following code is an example of a proof harness:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void aws_array_list_get_at_ptr_harness() {
    /* initialization */
    struct aws_array_list* list = can_fail_malloc(sizeof(*list));
    __CPROVER_assume(list != NULL));
    __CPROVER_assume(aws_array_list_is_bounded(list));
    ensure_array_list_has_allocated_data_member(list);

    /* generate unconstrained inputs */
    void **val = can_fail_malloc(sizeof(void *));
    size_t index;

    /* preconditions */
    __CPROVER_assume(aws_array_list_is_valid(list));
    __CPROVER_assume(val != NULL);

    /* call function under verification */
    if(!aws_array_list_get_at_ptr(list, val, index)) {
      /* If aws_array_list_get_at_ptr is successful,
       * i.e. ret==0, we ensure the list isn't
       * empty and index is within bounds */
        assert(list-&gt;data != NULL);
        assert(list-&gt;length &gt; index);
    }

    /* postconditions */
    assert(aws_array_list_is_valid(list));
    assert(val != NULL);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The harness shown above consists of five parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialize the data structure to unconstrained values.
We recommend initializers for all verified data structures use a consistent naming scheme:
<code>ensure_{data_structure}_has_allocated_data_member()</code>.</li>
<li>Generate unconstrained inputs to the function.</li>
<li>Constrain all inputs to meet the function specification and assume all preconditions using <code>assume</code> statements.
If necessary, bound the data structures so that the proof terminates.</li>
<li>Call the function under verification with these inputs.</li>
<li>Check any function postconditions using <code>assert</code> statements.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-to-write-a-good-proof-harness"><a class="header" href="#how-to-write-a-good-proof-harness">How to write a good proof harness</a></h3>
<p>We recommend approaching writing a proof-harness as an iterative process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a minimally constrained harness, which simply</p>
<ol>
<li>declares the necessary variables</li>
<li>and then calls the function under test using them.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, for the harness given above, an initial harness might look like:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-c">void aws_array_list_get_at_ptr_harness() {
    /* initialization */
    struct aws_array_list* list;

    /* generate unconstrained inputs */
    void **val;
    size_t index;

    /* call function under verification */
     aws_array_list_get_at_ptr(list, val, index);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that we are leaving the inputs to the function completely unconstrained: we are simply declaring them on the stack, and then using them without assigning any values to them.
In a normal C compiler, this would be undefined behaviour.
In CBMC, this is legal, but represents an <strong>unconstrained value</strong> (you may also hear this called a <strong>non-determinstic</strong> value).
The CBMC tool will use a mathematical solver which considers every possible value of an unconstrained variable.
If there exists a value which can cause an assertion failure, the solver will find it.
Conversely, if the solver says the assertion cannot be violated, this forms mathematical <em>proof</em> that no such value exists.</p>
<p>Leaving these values unconstrained will almost certainly lead to CBMC detecting violations, because real functions have implicit (or, if you're lucky, explicit) constraints on their inputs.
For example, it is typically a precondition of a function that pointers must either reference valid memory, or be <code>null</code>.
However, sometimes you may be surprised: if a function doesn't use a given input, or uses it in a defensive way, it may accept totally unconstrained values.
What we are attempting to do is find the minimum constraint that will allow the function to succeed with no assertion violations.
So we start with unconstrained values, and slowly constrain them just enough to get the function to verify.</p>
<ol>
<li>Run CBMC and observe the output.
In the case of our running example, you will see errors that look like this</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>   Errors
     * In include/aws/common/array_list.inl
       * In aws_array_list_get_at_ptr
         * Line 347:
           * [trace] val != ((void*)0) check failed
</code></pre>
<p>Consult our <a href="management/Debug-an-error-trace.html">guide to debugging CBMC output</a> for suggestions about how to understand this output.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Constrain each input in turn until all warnings are resolved.
See the sections on writing <code>_is_valid()</code> and <code>_ensure_is_allocated()</code> functions for details on how to do this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix any loop-unwinding errors.
To fix these errors, you will need update the Makefile with the correct loop bounds.
This may cause CBMC to get quite slow.
In this case, we recommend <strong>bounding</strong> the size of data-structures to allow CBMC to finish quickly.
In the harness above, this is accomplished by the line</p>
<pre><code>__CPROVER_assume(aws_array_list_is_bounded(list))
</code></pre>
<p>We recommend starting with very small bounds to ensure a quick REPL cycle.
Once the proof is finished, you can increase the bounds to increase assurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the coverage report.
Ideally, you will have 100% coverage.
In practice, coverage will be less than 100%, for e.g. in defensive code that redundantly checks for errors.
In this case, inspect the uncovered code, and ensure that it matches your expectations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase assurance by adding assertions to the harness.
There are typically three types of such assertions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data structures should remain valid, whether or not the function under test succeeded.</li>
<li>If the function failed, data-structures should remain unchanged.</li>
<li>If the function succeeded, data-structures should be updated according to the function semantics.</li>
</ol>
<p>In our example harness, this is handled by the lines</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-c">    /* call function under verification */
    if(!aws_array_list_get_at_ptr(list, val, index)) {
      /* If aws_array_list_get_at_ptr is successful,
       * i.e. ret==0, we ensure the list isn't
       * empty and index is within bounds */
        assert(list-&gt;data != NULL);
        assert(list-&gt;length &gt; index);
    }

    /* postconditions */
    assert(aws_array_list_is_valid(list));
    assert(val != NULL);

<h2 id="the-is_valid-function"><a class="header" href="#the-is_valid-function">The <code>is_valid()</code> function</a></h2>
<p>The <code>is_valid()</code> functions used in preconditions are developed using an iterative process.
For each <strong>data-structure</strong> module, start by specifying the simplest predicates that you can think of for the data structure --- usually, that the data of the data structure is correctly allocated.
Then, gradually refine these predicates, until you have a set of reasonable invariants for the data structure.</p>
<p>You can verify that invariants are reasonable by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Having an explicit code-review in which subject matter experts on the development team confirm that the invariants represent the design intent of the code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding these invariants are pre/post-conditions to the code being verified, and ensuring that all unit and regression tests pass.
Note that unit-test failures do not necessarily reflect problems with your invariants.
They may also reflect either</p>
<ol>
<li>Bugs in the code itself</li>
<li>Bugs in the unit-tests</li>
</ol>
<p>In both these cases, fix the bug in the code, then make sure the invariant now succeeds during the tests.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example-of-an-is_valid-function"><a class="header" href="#example-of-an-is_valid-function">Example of an <code>is_valid()</code> function</a></h3>
<p>For instance, in the case of the <code>array_list</code>, we started
with the invariant that <code>data</code> points to <code>current_size</code>
allocated bytes.
After several iterations, the validity invariant for <code>array_list</code> ended up looking like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">bool aws_array_list_is_valid(const struct aws_array_list *list) {
  if (!list) return false;
  size_t required_size = 0;
  bool required_size_is_valid = (aws_mul_size_checked(list-&gt;length, list-&gt;item_size, &amp;required_size) == AWS_OP_SUCCESS);
  bool current_size_is_valid = (list-&gt;current_size &gt;= required_size);
  bool data_is_valid = ((list-&gt;current_size == 0 &amp;&amp; list-&gt;data == NULL) || AWS_MEM_IS_WRITABLE(list-&gt;data, list-&gt;current_size));
  bool item_size_is_valid = (list-&gt;item_size != 0);

  return required_size_is_valid &amp;&amp; current_size_is_valid &amp;&amp; data_is_valid &amp;&amp; item_size_is_valid;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The invariant above describes four conditions satisfied by a valid <code>array_list</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>the sum of the sizes of the items of the list must fit in an unsigned integer of type <code>size_t</code>, which is checked using the function <code>aws_mul_size_checked</code></li>
<li>the size of the <code>array_list</code> in bytes (<code>current_size</code>) has to be larger than or equal to the sum of the sizes of its items;</li>
<li>the <code>data</code> pointer must point to a valid memory location; otherwise it must be <code>NULL</code> if the size of the <code>array_list</code> is zero;
This point is actually somewhat subtle: there was debate among the team about whether the pointer must be <code>NULL</code>, or whether any value was legal if the length was zero.
Writing an explicit <code>is_valid()</code> function forced the team to come to a precise decision.</li>
<li>the <code>item_size</code> must be positive.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-ensure_allocated-function"><a class="header" href="#the-ensure_allocated-function">The <code>ensure_allocated</code> function</a></h2>
<p>Ideally, all properties in a proof harness would be written in a declarative style.
Unfortunately, CBMC currently does not allow to use <code>__CPROVER_assume()</code> statements to assume that memory is correctly allocated for some data structure as a precondition for function verification.
Instead, memory must be explicitly allocated in the harness before calling the function under analysis using imperative calls to <code>malloc()</code>.
By default, CBMC <code>malloc()</code> never returns <code>null</code>.
So it is important that your <code>ensure_allocated</code> function explicitly defines cases where pointers can be <code>null</code>, using adequately placed calls to <code>__CPROVER_assume({some pointer} == null)</code>.</p>
<p>It is important to separate the work done in this function from the work done in an <code>is_valid</code> function.
This function should only worry about allocating the memory needed by the data-structure.
Any other validity constraints should be handled by the <code>is_valid()</code> check.</p>
<p>The <code>ensure</code> function for the running example is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void ensure_array_list_has_allocated_data_member(struct aws_array_list *const list) {
    if (list-&gt;current_size == 0 &amp;&amp; list-&gt;length == 0) {
        __CPROVER_assume(list-&gt;data == NULL);
        list-&gt;alloc = can_fail_allocator();
    } else {
        list-&gt;data = bounded_malloc(list-&gt;current_size);
        list-&gt;alloc = nondet_bool() ? NULL : can_fail_allocator();
    }

<p>We strongly recommend adding all checks and assumptions from the proof harness to the function being verified as runtime assertions.
This provides value in several ways.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It connects the code and the proof.</strong>
Proofs for all but the most simple functions require environment assumptions.
One of the most common ways proof can go wrong is when these assumptions the real-world context in which the function is used.
Adding the assumptions as runtime assertions in the code allows such mismatches to be detected as the code runs.
Some teams choose to enable these assertions only in debug mode; this allows mismatches to be detected during the standard unit and integration testing processes with any performance penalty on production code.
Other teams enable these assertions for all builds, providing increased assurance at a small runtime cost.</li>
<li><strong>It helps detect bugs in the broader codebase.</strong>
On a number of occasions, adding function contracts to correct code detected function contracts in other parts of the code base.
In several cases, we discovered errors in other projects, which were calling verified APIs with invalid parameters.
Even though those projects had never been formally verified, they still benefited from the function contracts developed during the formal verification work.</li>
<li><strong>It helps focus the mind.</strong>
It is easy to let standards slip during code-reviews for test and verification code.
&quot;Even if its not perfect, its better than nothing, so might as well just click approve.&quot;
Adding the proof assumptions and checks to the codebase itself as runtime assertions causes reviewers to take them much more seriously, which leads to both increased proof quality, and improved code quality.</li>

<p>In the running example, our verification harness assumed the following preconditions</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">    __CPROVER_assume(aws_array_list_is_valid(list));

<p>CBMC proof failures seem to come in batches: you run the proof, and see a dozen different errors reported
In many cases, these failures are related: instead of stressing about the number of failures, pick one, debug it, and see if fixing it removes (many of) the others.
Some good heuristics for deciding which failure to investigate:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Look for a failure that occurs early on in the proof.</strong>
This will often be the one with the shortest trace [TODO viewer should output this information].
The shorter the trace leading to the issue, the easier it is to debug.</li>
<li><strong>Look for a failure in code you understand.</strong>
Some functions are simpler than others: a failure in a simple function is often easier to analyze that one in a complicated function.
And a failure in a function you understand is easier than one in a function you are not familiar with.</li>
<li><strong>Look for a simple type of failure.</strong>
For example, the trace from a null dereference is often easier to follow than the trace for a use of a DEAD pointer.
But they're normally exactly the same bug!
Since null dereference bugs normally give the simplest traces, start with them first.
Often, resolving the null dereference also fixes the other related bugs.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-do-i-debug-a-proof-failure"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-debug-a-proof-failure">How do I debug a proof failure?</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of techniques that have proven useful in debugging proof failures.</p>
<h3 id="read-the-trace"><a class="header" href="#read-the-trace">Read the trace</a></h3>
<p>[TODO link to a guide to viewer]
CBMC viewer generates a step-by-step trace that leads to the assertion violation.
This trace details</p>
<ul>
<li>Every line of code executed</li>
<li>Every function call made</li>
<li>Every time a variable is assigned</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, this trace contains everything you would get from attaching a debugger to the program, and single stepping until the violation occurred.
Take a look at the values of the relevant variables right before the assertion violation.
Do they make sense?
If not, figure out where they were assigned.
I often find that <code>Ctrl-F</code> is my friend here: I search for either the variable name, or the value it was assigned, and see where it appears in the trace.</p>
<p>Similarly, look at the set of function calls that led to the error.
Do they make sense?
Are there functions you expect to see there, but don't?
Are there functions you didn't expect to see there, but do?</p>
<h3 id="add-additional-information-to-the-trace"><a class="header" href="#add-additional-information-to-the-trace">Add additional information to the trace</a></h3>
<p>The trace has all the information you need to understand the state of program memory at every point during the execution.
But its not always that easy to reconstruct.
In particular, the trace records the value of a variable when it is written to.
But it doesn't record the value of a variable that is only read, or passed along to another function.</p>
<p>You can solve this by adding &quot;dummy writes&quot; to the program.
For example, let's say you were debugging an error that involved the following function</p>
<pre><code>int foo(struct bar* b, int x) {
    baz(b-&gt;data, x);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Figuring out the value of <code>b-&gt;data</code> and <code>x</code> are possible given a complete trace, but its difficult.
Any it might harder to figure out the value of <code>b-&gt;size</code>.
Instead, annotate the code to track those values:</p>
<pre><code>int foo(struct bar* b, int x) {
        struct bar debug_foo_b = *b;
        int debug_foo_x = x;
    baz(b-&gt;data, x);
}
</code></pre>
<p>the trace will now contain an assignment to <code>debug_foo_b</code>, which will let you see what values each member of the struct had.</p>
<h3 id="delta-debugging"><a class="header" href="#delta-debugging">Delta debugging</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://web2.cs.columbia.edu/%7Ejunfeng/09fa-e6998/papers/delta-debug.pdf">Delta debugging</a> is a powerful technique for localizing faults and creating minimal reproducing test-cases.
Essentially, you modify the program in some way, typically either by removing (commenting out) or modifying code.
You then rerun the verification tool, and see if the results changed.
The goal is to either:</p>
<ol>
<li>produce a small program which still displays the bug or</li>
<li>produce a small change between two programs, one of which has the bug, and the other doesn't.</li>
</ol>
<p>In case 1, you now have a small program which is hopefully easy to understand;
In case 2, you have a small change which induces the bug, and hopefully leads you toward the root cause.</p>
<h3 id="add-assertions-to-check-your-hypotheses"><a class="header" href="#add-assertions-to-check-your-hypotheses">Add assertions to check your hypotheses.</a></h3>
<p>For example, consider the case of a null pointer dereference of a pointer <code>p</code>.
It is important to distinguish the case where the pointer <em>must</em> be null, vs the case where it <em>may</em> be null, vs the case where it <em>is never</em> null.
You can test for these cases by adding <code>assert(p)</code> to the function.
If the can be null, the assertion will trigger.
If it cannot be null, the assertion will succeed.</p>
<p>Now, check <code>assert(!p)</code> instead.
If can be non-null, this assertion will fail.
If it can only be null, this assertion will succeed.</p>
<p>You now know which one of the three cases is true.
And you can use the trace to see why it can be null/non-null.</p>
<p>You can do similar things to determine why a branch is reachable, or unreachable.</p>
<h3 id="use-assert0-to-dump-program-state-leading-to-a-checkpoint"><a class="header" href="#use-assert0-to-dump-program-state-leading-to-a-checkpoint">Use <code>assert(0)</code> to dump program state leading to a checkpoint</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, you want to know how/whether a particular line of code is reachable.
One easy way to learn that is to put <code>assert(0)</code> right before the line.
CBMC will detect the assertion violation, and give a trace explaining how it reached there, and with what values.
If the assertion passes without error, you know that the line is unreachable given the current proof harness.</p>
<h3 id="use-assume-to-block-uninteresting-paths"><a class="header" href="#use-assume-to-block-uninteresting-paths">Use <code>assume(...)</code> to block uninteresting paths</a></h3>
<p>There are often many possible execution paths that reach a given line of code / assertion.
Some of these may reflect cases you are trying to understand, while others do not help with your current debugging plan.
Left to its own devices, CBMC will non-deterministically choose one of those traces, which may not be the one you want.
You can guide CBMC to the trace you want by sprinkling <code>__CPROVER_assume()</code> statements within the code.
For example, you might <code>__CPROVER_assume()</code> that a function fails with an error code, to test whether the calling function handles that error code correctly.
Or you might <code>__CPROVER_assume()</code> that a given variable is null, to simplify you search for the root cause of a null dereference.</p>
<h3 id="consider-the-possibility-it-is-a-fault-in-the-code-being-verified"><a class="header" href="#consider-the-possibility-it-is-a-fault-in-the-code-being-verified">Consider the possibility it is a fault in the code being verified</a></h3>
<p>In many cases, the error detected by CBMC represents a true issue within the code being verified.
This is particularly common in the case of functions which fail to validate their inputs.
In this case, the fix is either to validate the inputs, and return an error if given invalid inputs, or to document the requirements on the inputs, and state that actions on illegal inputs are undefined behaviour.
Which solution you choose depends on the risk profile of the code.</p>
<p>It is also common that code being verified has integer-overflows and other errors that only occur in unusual circumstances.
In these cases, the solution is to either guarantee that inputs are sufficiently small to prevent these issues, or to use overflow-safe builtins, such as gcc's <code>__builtin_mul_overflow</code> (documented <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Integer-Overflow-Builtins.html">here</a>).</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-improve-proofs-with-low-coverage"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-improve-proofs-with-low-coverage">How do I improve proofs with low coverage?</a></h2>
<h3 id="fix-any-error-detected-by-cbmc"><a class="header" href="#fix-any-error-detected-by-cbmc">Fix any error detected by CBMC</a></h3>
<p>Make sure that there are no missing function definitions, or property violations.
Both of these errors can affect coverage calculations.</p>
<h3 id="check-for-truly-unreachable-code"><a class="header" href="#check-for-truly-unreachable-code">Check for truly unreachable code.</a></h3>
<p>In some cases, code may be truly unreachable - for example, redundant defensive checks.
Or this may be code which is reachable using particular inputs, but not in the context of your proof.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>int size_from_enum(type_enum t) {
        switch (t) {
        case BAR: return 1;
        case BAZ: return 2;
        ...
}

int function_being_tested() {
        return size_from_enum(BAZ);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, most of the lines in <code>size_from_enum</code> will appear to be unreachable, even though the proof has full coverage of all truly reachable paths.</p>
<h3 id="check-for-over-constrained-inputs"><a class="header" href="#check-for-over-constrained-inputs">Check for over-constrained inputs</a></h3>
<p>Consider the case where one side of a branch is not reached, or where execution does not continue past an assumption.
In this case, it is possible that the inputs have been over-constrained in the proof harness. You can try to relax some of the <code>__CPROVER_assume()</code> statements.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-tell-if-my-proof-is-over-constrained"><a class="header" href="#how-can-i-tell-if-my-proof-is-over-constrained">How can I tell if my proof is over-constrained?</a></h2>
<p>This will normally appear in coverage - overconstrained proofs will usually have unreachable portions of code.
You can also add a &quot;smoke test&quot;, but adding assertions that you expect to fail to the code (which can be as simple as <code>assert(0)</code>).
If these assertions do not fail, then something is wrong with your proof.</p>

<li>Push it to a public github repo (if possible)</li>
<li>Post a bug report <a href="https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc/issues/new">here</a>, linking to the branch that you pushed containing the bug.</li>

<p>The basic principles of coding for verification are similar to those of coding for testability, with some modifications due to the nature of the SAT solver underlying CBMC.</p>
<h2 id="code-organization-to-support-verification"><a class="header" href="#code-organization-to-support-verification">Code Organization to Support Verification</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Write small functions. Functions should:
<ul>
<li>Do exactly one thing.</li>
<li>Take all their input and outputs through function parameters and rely as little as possible on global state. Where possible, avoid global variables.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Encapsulate interaction with the environment within a small function. Interaction with the environment includes accessing files, the network, etc. This makes is possible to verify that function independently and then stub it out for the rest of the verification.</li>
<li>Functions should check their input parameters, and return an error code when they fail to verify.
This makes harnesses much simpler, since any value for the parameters is a valid input to the function.</li>
<li>Avoid unbounded loops as far as possible, and encapsulate the ones that you need.  CBMC does bounded model checking, so we need to be able to compute a bound on the number of iterations of any given loop.  Loops that iterate a constant number of times are best.   Loops whose iteration depends on input will require making some assumptions about the input.</li>
<li>Consider defining magic numbers that control loop bounds and buffer sizes in your build system, i.e., <code>-DBUFFER_SIZE=1024</code> and similar. This ensures that you can configure this value at build time, and we can also use those values in our proofs.</li>
<li>Provide an easy way to access static functions and data structures for testing, if you must have them. For example, use a macro that overrides static.</li>
<li>Make threads independently verifiable. When writing concurrent programs, reduce interaction to well-defined points. This enables verification of each thread in isolation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="improving-verification-performance"><a class="header" href="#improving-verification-performance">Improving Verification Performance</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid void pointers (<code>void*</code>). There are two reasons people use void pointers:
<ul>
<li>To hide implementation detail.  This use of void pointers is unnecessary, because we can replace <code>void *bar</code> with <code>struct foo *bar</code> and declare <code>struct foo</code> later within the implementation.</li>
<li>To implement a form of polymorphism.  Don't do this for gratuitous reasons (e.g., because it might someday be useful).  Void pointers can block constant propagation which can dramatically reduce the size of the formula constructed for the constraint solver.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid function pointers. When unavoidable, ensure that function pointer types match a minimum number of candidate functions signatures in your code base (ideally just one). They really can make the difference between a proof and no proof.  When CBMC encounters a function pointer, it has to consider all possibilities for what that function could be, based on loose signature matching.  CBMC has to consider possible any function in the entire program whose address is taken with a signature matching the function pointer.  So for each function invocation, the symbolic execution of a single function is replaced with the symbolic execution of a collection of functions (including the functions they call), and the combinatorial explosion makes the size of the formula too big for memory. The worst thing you can do is to give your functions the signature <code>void foo(void *arg)</code>; see the point above about avoiding <code>void*</code>.</li>
<li>Large (more than several kB in size) arrays can cause trouble. Again, defining the sizes of arrays in the build system means that we can cleanly re-define them to smaller bounds for our proofs.</li>
<li>Data-structures should explicitly carry their size, as a parameter (e.g., Pascal strings are better than C strings).</li>
<li>Stay type safe.
<ul>
<li>Allocate the correct size of objects. Don't allocate less than the correct size for a struct even if you're only using some of its fields.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consider encapsulating loops in a function, or even just the loop body. Nested loops can lead to a combinatorial explosion in the size of the formula sent to the constraint solver.  Encapsulated loops can be specified and validated in isolation, and the simpler specification can be used in place of the function in the rest of the validation.</li>
<li>Try to minimize string comparisons</li>
<li>E.g., instead of making a <code>string-&gt;string</code> hash table, consider an <code>enum-&gt;string</code> hash-table.</li>

as described in the training material.</p>
<p>Feel free to use any naming scheme that makes sense for your project --- some

consistent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All nontrivial data structures have an

<p>These definitions are most commonly stored in the <code>proofs/sources</code>
subdirectory of the starter kit. Definitions are stored here and used
consistently in the proofs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All pointers passed as input are allocated on the heap with <code>malloc</code>.</p>
<p>One common mistake is to allocate a buffer <code>buf</code> on the stack and to

<p>Note that some exceptions are required.  For example, it may be necessary
in an <code>ensure_allocated</code> to assume <code>length &lt; CBMC_MAX_OBJECT_SIZE</code> before
invoking <code>malloc(length)</code> to avoid a false positive about malloc'ing a
too-big object. But every instance of <code>__CPROVER_assume</code> in supporting code

assumptions to be documented in one place.</p>

described in <a href="management/Write-a-good-proof.html">Write a good proof</a>.
The check list above ensures that the properties (including the
assumptions about the input) that must be true before function
invocation are clearly stated in the proof harness. Consider adding
a statement of what properties must be true after function invocation
as assertions at the end of the proof harness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider adding the assumptions made by the proof harness for a
function under test to the source code for the function in the form
of assertions in the code. This will validate that the assumptions made
by the proof of a function are satisfied by each invocation of the function
(at least during testing).</p>
